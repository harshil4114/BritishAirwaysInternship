# British Airways certification with Forage

Welcome to my project repository, where I share the insights and models developed during my completion of the British Airways Data Science Certification in collaboration with Forage. This program was an enriching journey into the world of data science, focusing on its application within the airline industry.

## About the Certification

The certification course offered a comprehensive exploration of data science, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction at British Airways. Through a series of simulations and hands-on projects, I gained practical experience in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

### Key Learnings

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Utilized Python libraries (Numpy, pandas, sklearn, nltk) for data analysis and employed matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed predictive models using techniques like Kmeans clustering, XGB classifier, and random forest classifier on customer booking data to forecast buying behaviors.
- **Customer Insight**: Analyzed customer review data to extract meaningful insights into customer preferences and behaviors, aiding in the construction of a predictive model focused on understanding the factors influencing buying decisions.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the projects and models developed during the certification. Here's what you can find inside:

- `data_analysis/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis process using Python libraries.
- `visualization/`: Charts and graphs created with matplotlib and seaborn to visualize findings.
- `predictive_models/`: Python scripts for the predictive models developed using various machine learning techniques.
- `customer_insights/`: Analysis of customer review data and the predictive model focusing on buying behavior.
